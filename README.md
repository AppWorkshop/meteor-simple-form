# Simple Form

A meteorite package that allows you to easily use minimongoid and handlebars helpers to have data bindings between a model (one collection item) and a form element.

We came from a Rails background and we loved Simple Form, so we wanted to have similar functionality when working on Meteor - it just makes life easier.

See more in our [documentation](http://github.differential.io/simple-form/)
